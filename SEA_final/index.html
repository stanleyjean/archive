                </p>
        <p>
            I think art can help people to reflect upon themselves in terms of what they feel and how they feel. In this sense, this article is focused on having an opportunity to look at the easily neglected agonised. This may not be only about an individual self-awareness of their sufferings but also about collective awareness towards each neglected piece of our society where we see only what we habitually see. 
        </p>
        <p>I am going to distinguish anxiety from stress to make the discussion specific since I want to specify what is “unnoticed” sufferings. Whilst stress has a specific trigger that causes it, anxiety does not have any certain trigger.  Then, anxiety gives out a feeling that is unclear even to a person who is experiencing it, making the person suffer from it blindly. That is, anxiety does not rely on such a trigger as mentioned above and so a different approach has to be made more than just eradicating a trigger.  </p>

        <p>Thus, I think that it is a requirement that people be able to reflect upon their anxiety to deal with their sufferings with <a class = "newtab" href= "https://www.mindful.org/meditation/mindfulness-getting-started/">mindfulness</a> in order to soothe themselves from anxiety that cannot be handled by removing some “causes.” Mindfulness is a term that describes the action to be aware of our present life without overreacting to it. Then, I mean, by mindfulness, that looking at our own status without being possessed by sufferings. In this sense, I claim that arts that describe sufferings of artists from their own experiences and feelings can surely help audiences contemplate on their own “worlds”, with distance, through what surfaces on the arts. By this aspect of arts, each individual that appreciates the artworks will have an opportunity to look at their “sufferings” from lenses of others. As what mindfulness does, art will provoke the very act of recognising what is going on around one’s mind to help them overcome those sufferings.  </p>

        <p>Art will not only give a chance to each individual to perceive their own sufferings but make a space where others, who haven’t even experienced or known of sufferings described, get a clue of the undefined world of sufferings. Artworks describing steps of dementia by William Utermohlen give us the sense of what I mean above. His self-portraits show the gradual changes that he had experienced while suffering from dementia. We cannot really feel what happens in the inner side of someone else. “What goes on inside the mind of another person is always a mystery, but with very advanced dementia, mystery becomes terrifyingly impenetrable; twilight to pitch dark” and “art, however, can try to enter the silent darkness” from <a class = "newtab" href = "https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2015/jul/19/dementia-and-the-arts-fiction-films-drama-poetry-painting">an article of the Guardian.</a> </p>

        <p>This is not to propose clinical power of art, rather to show the possibility that art can take as a catalyst for “others” and each individual to see the world of the anxious and agonising. In not a few cases, people suffering from their own agonies do not even consider the sufferings as problems, only denouncing themselves with words like flawed or defective in coping with such problems. I want to focus on this “blind spot” which anyone easily ignores or neglects, unlike physical issues that are comparatively much more visible and manifest.

            <figcaption>Darkness Visible by William Styron</figcaption>
        </figure></p>
            
        <p>
            
            From "Darkness Visible", William Styron wrote “… That the word “indescribable” should present itself is not fortuitous, since it has to be emphasized that if the pain were readily describable most of the countless sufferers from this ancient affliction would have been able to confidently depict for their friends and loved ones ….”, “This memory of my relative indifference is important because such indifference demonstrates powerfully the outsider’s inability to grasp the essence of the illness (depression).” Even for a person like the author who has seriously suffered from and experienced unstable period and is more than capable of describing the period as an established writer, it was not easy to convey what the suffering felt like. 
        </p>
        <p>
            He also showed surprise, in the same piece, that the editorial he wrote to New York Times about the suicide of Primo Levi resonated among many people oppressed but eager to share their similar feelings with what he described in the editorial. The mere action of conveying the phenomenon related to mental issues can help people experience an empathic environment through which they all share and see that they are not left desolate. 
            <div class = "quote">“Depression is notoriously hard to describe, but Styron managed to split the atom.” <br> “You are not alone, Styron reminded his readers, and the fog will lift. Patience is paramount.” <br>
                <a class = "newtab" href = "https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2014/12/the-hope-that-william-styrons-darkness-visible-offers-25-years-later/383406/"><div style = "text-align: right;">Excerpted from an article of The Atalantic</div></a></div>
        </p>

        <p>
            Especially, the piece of William Styron gives us personal and intimate dialogue of his sufferings. The letters he received after writing the opinion-editorial for The New York Times and publishing the book "Darkness Visible" demonstrate that his writings and literature go beyond simply documenting his own experiences. They help people perceive their sufferings not being left alone in solitude and others empathise with the sufferings present inside of people. </p>

            <figcaption>Album arts of Everywhere at the End of Time 
                (Stage I - IV, the first line is with I - III and the second line is with IV - VI)</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>There has been a musical project, The Caretaker, by Leyland James Kirby(LJK) for exploring the process of dementia. It is also well-known for the notoriously long and yet full of sad, depressing atmosphere. Not so surprisingly, there used to be a TikTok challenge for listening through “Everywhere at the End of Time” by The Caretaker, which is around 6 hours long. Some argued that it is not just a meme but a real depiction of those sufferings, implying that it has to be respected with sincerity not just as a tool to accomplish an online challenge. The artist, LJK, however, was not bothered with such a challenge. He didn’t feel that the challenge is “disrespecting his work” at all and said “I think that anything that can enable awareness, open a discussion and give people some empathy with people and family members suffering from Alzheimer’s and dementia especially among the young is a good thing” from <a class = "newtab" href = "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/23/style/tiktok-caretaker-challenge-dementia.html">an interview with NYT</a>. This quote of his expresses the most significant of aspect of art in dealing with issues related with mentality; by raising awareness of them in people, who are outside or inside of the issues, empathic – or even friendly – social atmosphere in our lives can be forged for the matter.  </p>

        <p>From the album arts of Everywhere at the End of Time, it is also noticeable that the possibility of art for showing the missing, or blind, spots that people not experiencing such problems would not be able to perceive. It consists of stage I – VI, each of which represents the gradual change of dementia as depicted in each album art. As we saw briefly in the works of William Utermohlen, these arts give us an opportunity to recognise the neglected or mystical part of others that we are unaware of. A mere disease that deprives oneself of capabilities as a human being is easily considered as nothing but a phenomenon that surfaces lightly. The work of The Caretaker lets us feel and see the actual process and sentiments that those suffering from dementia would have. </p>

            <figcaption>An artwork from the exhibition by Orominkyung</figcaption>
        </figure>
        
        <p>Describing a certain aspect of our lives, in this article the instability of our lives, can be effectively done with visual forms as well. From <a class = "newtab" href = "https://orominkyung.com/2019">the exhibition 영인과 나비: 끝의 입자 연구소에서 온 편지(Young-In and Butterfly: A Letter Sent from the End of Particle Laboratory)</a> by 오로민경 (Orominkyung) in 2019, the artist conveys a story of a fictional woman, Young-In, alienated from the society of which she was a part. People easily otherised through the features that usual people do not experience or suffer from are abandoned from their societies and even from themselves.  </p>
        
        <p>
            For the exhibition, the artist mentioned that she had wanted to make a space where how to live together with an ill and vulnerable body can be discussed. I think this is where discrepancy with norms of what we should be or do matters. Especially in Korea, whether good or bad, sticking out of social norms is not considered to be appropriate. For those who suffer from not-so-freely discussed matters, it never is comfortable to reveal their own sufferings that may not be understood even by themselves as one living in the society, and by most of the people of the society. The artist, 오로민경, seems to have wanted to involve those suffering from unusual, or “abnormal,” properties into a place where they can talk with less of hesitation. With involving those people into her world of discussion, the artist tried to show a neglected part of our society, which we routinely take for granted and yet some does not feel comfortable with. She also talked about accessibility of people on wheelchair in the process of preparing the exhibition. The whole picture of the exhibition tells us that we need to look around with opening our eyes to see what we are missing when we are preoccupied with only what is only easily visible to us.

        </p>
        <p>
            Each of the artworks discussed in this article shows the role of art to reveal the parts of people, which easily go unnoticed, mysterious, and even cryptic. The parts are never trivial regardless of their obscurity. They all are crucial to lives of us and those of others that experience them. For they affect the way we live by with others as they mold our views towards others. As we saw, a personal documentation of William Styron ignited stories of others having similar sufferings. A mere separate awareness of a suffering by any kind is capable of becoming a collective action towards the issue. Like Leyland James Kirby said, art can give an understanding of sufferings that people cannot actually “feel.” 
            </p>
            <p>
        Art presents visibility to sufferings that are practically invisible in our society. Undiscussed, or silently discussed, sufferings can never be considered serious as nobody knows what it is like and how it is to gauge hardships people suffer from let alone those actually suffering. Art opens a discussion by which we obtain a chance to grasp and to empathise with sufferings of others and ourselves.
