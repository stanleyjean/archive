            I believe art can help individuals reflect upon themselves in terms of their emotions and experiences. In this sense, the article is focused on providing an opportunity to examine the often overlooked or disregarded experiences of those who are in pain or suffering, which is invisible or imperceptible to those not experiencing it or to even those who are experiencing it but do not have a word to define what they feel. This wil not be only to raise an individual self-awareness of each suffering but also collective awareness of it to embrace those suffering. 
        </p>
        <p class = "text">I think that it is a requirement that people be able to reflect upon their sufferings with such a method as <a class = "newtab" href= "https://www.mindful.org/meditation/mindfulness-getting-started/">mindfulness</a> in order to soothe themselves from easily neglected sufferings. Mindfulness is a term that describes the action to be aware of our present life without overreacting to it. Then, I mean, by mindfulness, that looking at our own status without being possessed by sufferings. From this necessity of reflecting upon sufferings, I claim that art, which portrays sufferings and agonies, can serve as a catalyst for raising awareness of hidden or unseen forms of sufferings unnoticed by what surfaces on them. As what mindfulness does, art will provoke the very act of recognising what is going on around sufferings, which eventually help us to be aware of them.</p>

    <p class = "text">Art will not only give a chance to each individual to perceive their own sufferings but make a space where others, who haven’t even experienced or known of sufferings described, get a clue of the undefined world of sufferings. Artworks describing steps of dementia by William Utermohlen give us the sense of what I mean above. His self-portraits vividly depict the gradual changes he experienced while battling dementia. The inner workings of another person's mind are always shrouded in mystery, but as dementia progresses, this mystery becomes frighteningly impenetrable, transitioning from twilight to pitch darkness. However, as expressed in <a class = "newtab" href = "https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2015/jul/19/dementia-and-the-arts-fiction-films-drama-poetry-painting">an article</a> from The Guardian, 'art, however, can try to enter the silent darkness,' suggesting that through art, we can attempt to bridge the gap and gain sense into the profound experiences of those suffering from dementia.</p>


        <p class = "text">This article is not obviously to propose clinical power of art, rather to show the possibility that art can take as a catalyst for people and each individual to see the world of the anxious and agonising. In not a few cases, even people suffering from their own agonies do not even consider the sufferings as problems, only denouncing themselves with words like flawed or defective in coping with such problems. I want to focus on this blind spot which anyone easily ignores or neglects, unlike physical disease or illness that is comparatively much more visible and manifest.

            In his work "Darkness Visible," William Styron reflects on the challenges of describing the experience of suffering, particularly in the context of depression. Styron emphasises the word "indescribable" because it underscores the difficulty in conveying the pain associated with this ancient affliction. He suggests that if the suffering were easily describable, those who endure it would have been able to effectively communicate their experiences to their friends and loved ones. Styron also highlights the author's personal indifference to understand another person’s suffering, implying that the outsider of the suffering is mostly incapable of grasping the essence of depression. I saw, from his writing, that even for someone with first-hand knowledge of the suffering, it remains arduous to accurately convey what the experience truly feels like. I want to emphasise the significant challenge of comprehending and communicating the profound nature of suffering, which in essence is invisible and intangible.
        </p>
        <p class = "text">
            In the same piece, Styron expresses his surprise at the resonance of an editorial he wrote for the New York Times concerning the suicide of Primo Levi. He discovered that his words struck a chord among many people who had experienced oppression and were eager to connect and share their similar feelings with what he had described in the editorial. This revelation highlighted the power of conveying the phenomenon related to invisible sufferings. By openly discussing and addressing them, people can create an empathic environment where they realise they are not alone in their struggles. This sense of shared experience can help combat the desolation that individuals may feel, fostering a supportive and understanding community.
            
            <div class = "quote text">“Depression is notoriously hard to describe, but Styron managed to split the atom.” <br> “You are not alone, Styron reminded his readers, and the fog will lift. Patience is paramount.” <br>

        </p>

        <p class = "text">
            William Styron's personal account in his work, "Darkness Visible," offers a deeply personal and intimate dialogue about his own sufferings. However, the impact of his writings extends beyond mere documentation of his experiences. The letters he received after writing the opinion-editorial for The New York Times and publishing the book serve as evidence of the profound effect his literature has had on others. Through his words, Styron not only helps individuals perceive their own sufferings and realise they are not alone in their solitude but also brings awareness to those who have not experienced such suffering. His piece allows those who are not directly affected by the same struggles to understand and empathise with the experiences of those who are suffering. By shedding light on the depth and impact of suffering, Styron also bridges the gap between the sufferers and those who may be unaware of or distant from such experiences. In this way, he creates a broader understanding and compassion among readers, fostering a sense of solidarity and support for individuals facing various forms of suffering.</p>

        <p class = "text">"The Caretaker" is a notable musical project of Leyland James Kirby (LJK) that delves into the experience of dementia. The project is renowned for an album series of extended duration, Everywhere at the End of Time, and evokes a somber and melancholic atmosphere. Interestingly, there was a TikTok challenge that emerged where participants attempted to listen to the whole series of "Everywhere at the End of Time" by The Caretaker, a six-hour-long composition. While some frowned upon the act of taking it merely as a meme or an online challenge, they mentioned that it is a genuine portrayal of the sufferings associated with dementia, emphasizing the need for sincere respect rather than trivializing it for the sake of a viral trend. LJK, the artist behind the project, was not bothered by the challenge and did not perceive it as disrespecting his work. In <a class = "newtab" href = "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/23/style/tiktok-caretaker-challenge-dementia.html">an interview</a> with the New York Times, he expressed that anything that promotes awareness, sparks discussions, and fosters empathy for those affected by Alzheimer's and dementia, particularly among younger generations, is beneficial. This quote highlights the profound impact of art in addressing sufferings intangible to ordinary people, by raising awareness among both those directly affected and those not directly related to the sufferings, ultimately fostering an empathetic and supportive social environment.</p>


        <p class = "text">Examining the album art of "Everywhere at the End of Time," one can observe its potential to illuminate the hidden or obscure aspects that individuals without firsthand experience of dementia might struggle to comprehend. The album is divided into six stages, each represented by distinct artwork that symbolises the gradual progression of dementia. As demonstrated by the works of William Utermohlen, these artistic creations provide us with an opportunity to acknowledge the overlooked and enigmatic facets of others' experiences. Often, diseases that strip individuals of their human capacities are regarded superficially, merely as surface-level phenomena. However, the work of The Caretaker enables us to immerse ourselves in the actual process and sentiments that individuals suffering from dementia experience.</p>

Through visual arts, the artist conveys the story of a fictional woman named Young-In, who becomes alienated from the society to which she once belonged. This artwork explores how individuals who possess characteristics or experiences that differ from the norm are often marginalised, abandoned not only by society but also by themselves.</p>
        
        <p class = "text">In creating this exhibition, the artist expressed her intention to establish a space where discussions about living with an ill and vulnerable body could take place. This discrepancy between societal norms and individual experiences is particularly relevant in Korea, where deviating from social expectations is often frowned upon. People who suffer from less-openly-discussed issues find it uncomfortable to reveal their own sufferings, which may not even be fully understood by themselves or by the majority of society. It seems that the artist, 오로민경, aimed to involve those who are burdened with unusual, or less-understood, qualities into a space where they could engage in conversation with less hesitation. By inviting these individuals into her world of discussion, the artist aimed to shed light on a neglected part of the society that is routinely taken for granted but uncomfortable for some of the society. Regarding this neglected part, the artist also prioritised accessibility for people using wheelchairs during the exhibition's preparation, emphasizing the need to open our eyes and look beyond what is easily visible to us.</p>

        <p class = "text">The exhibition "영인과 나비: 끝의 입자 연구소에서 온 편지" (Young-In and Butterfly: A Letter Sent from the End of Particle Laboratory) underscores the importance of uncovering the hidden, or easily neglected, aspects of our lives. It highlights the need to create spaces where individuals with not-so-common experiences can openly discuss their struggles and challenges, challenging societal norms and encouraging a more inclusive and empathetic society.</p>

        <p class = "text">The artworks examined in this article demonstrate the profound impact of art in illuminating the often overlooked and enigmatic aspects of human experience. Each artwork, whether it be William Styron's introspective writings, Everywhere at the End of Time by The Caretaker, or 오로민경's exhibition "영인과 나비," plays a vital role in revealing the hidden sufferings and challenges that individuals can face.</p>
        <p class = "text">William Styron's personal account of depression in "Darkness Visible" not only allows individuals to recognise their own suffering but also bridges the gap between those who have experienced similar struggles and those that might be unaware of the struggles. The resonance of Styron's writings among his readers emphasises the power of conveying invisible sufferings and fostering a sense of shared experience and support.</p>
        <p class = "text">Similarly, The Caretaker's album series, "Everywhere at the End of Time," provides a unique insight into the progression of dementia, offering a glimpse into the profound experiences of those affected by the condition. By immersing listeners in the journey of dementia, the album series raises awareness and generates empathy, even among those who have not directly encountered the disease.</p>
        <p class = "text">오로민경's exhibition, "영인과 나비," confronts the societal marginalization faced by individuals with atypical characteristics or experiences. By creating a space for open dialogue and discussion, 오로민경 sheds light on the neglected aspects of our society and challenges societal norms. Through her artwork, she encourages inclusivity, empathy, and a deeper understanding of the struggles faced by individuals who deviate from societal expectations.</p>
        <p class = "text">In each case, art serves as a catalyst for awareness, empathy, and collective action. It allows us to recognise and understand the sufferings of others, even when they are invisible or difficult to comprehend. By fostering discussions and providing a platform for reflection, art enables us to grasp the complexities of human sufferings and fosters a more compassionate and supportive society.</p>
        <p class = "text">In a world where some sufferings go unnoticed or are silently discussed, art has the power to bring these issues to the forefront and initiate meaningful conversations. It reminds us that our understanding and empathy can extend beyond our own experiences, helping us to connect with the suffering of others and create a more inclusive and compassionate world.</p>
        <p class = "text">By exploring the depths of human experience through various art forms, we gain a unique perspective and a chance to truly empathise with the sufferings of others and ourselves. Art acts as a bridge, allowing us to notice our individual perspectives and engage in collective understanding of those sufferings.</p>
