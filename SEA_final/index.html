                </p>
        <p>
            I think art can help people to reflect upon themselves in terms of what they feel and how they feel. In this sense, this article is focused on having an opportunity to look at the easily neglected agonised. This may not be only about an individual self-awareness of their sufferings but also about collective awareness towards each neglected piece of our society where we see only what we habitually see. 
        </p>
        <p>I am going to distinguish anxiety from stress to make the discussion specific since I want to specify what is “unnoticed” sufferings. Whilst stress has a specific trigger that causes it, anxiety does not have any certain trigger.  Then, anxiety gives out a feeling that is unclear even to a person who is experiencing it, making the person suffer from it blindly. That is, anxiety does not rely on such a trigger as mentioned above and so a different approach has to be made more than just eradicating a trigger.  </p>

        <p>Thus, I think that it is a requirement that people be able to reflect upon their anxiety to deal with their sufferings with <a class = "newtab" href= "https://www.mindful.org/meditation/mindfulness-getting-started/">mindfulness</a> in order to soothe themselves from anxiety that cannot be handled by removing some “causes.” Mindfulness is a term that describes the action to be aware of our present life without overreacting to it. Then, I mean, by mindfulness, that looking at our own status without being possessed by sufferings. In this sense, I claim that arts that describe sufferings of artists from their own experiences and feelings can surely help audiences contemplate on their own “worlds”, with distance, through what surfaces on the arts. By this aspect of arts, each individual that appreciates the artworks will have an opportunity to look at their “sufferings” from lenses of others. As what mindfulness does, art will provoke the very act of recognising what is going on around one’s mind to help them overcome those sufferings.  </p>

            <img src = "./image/William-Utermohlen-compos-009.webp" alt = "Self-portraits of William  Utermohlen. Six pictures are present in a single image files. The first one is a usual self-portrait. All face features are clearly described. The second one has yellow skin-colour with a bit irritated facial expression. The thrid one has eyes located much more below than the other ones. The background colour is total black. And the facial expression shows gloomy atmosphere. The fourth one shows a bit of tears with confusing background pictures. Face features are much more blurry than other ones. The fifth one doesn't even have any face features discernable. We cannot even call it a &quot face &quot. The sixth one has a nose and mouth but no other face feature. The nose and mouth are properly positioned. And the oval shape, which we could consider as a face, is melting. And there's no colour used here. Only drawn by a pencil.">
            <figcaption>Details from William Utermohlen’s self-portraits, the first, made in 1967, the rest from 1996 the year following his diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease, to 2000, charting his decline. Photograph: Images courtesy of the artist’s estate and GVArt Gallery, London</figcaption>

        <p>Art will not only give a chance to each individual to perceive their own sufferings but make a space where others, who haven’t even experienced or known of sufferings described, get a clue of the undefined world of sufferings. Artworks describing steps of dementia by William Utermohlen give us the sense of what I mean above. His self-portraits show the gradual changes that he had experienced while suffering from dementia. We cannot really feel what happens in the inner side of someone else. “What goes on inside the mind of another person is always a mystery, but with very advanced dementia, mystery becomes terrifyingly impenetrable; twilight to pitch dark” and “art, however, can try to enter the silent darkness” from <a class = "newtab" href = "https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2015/jul/19/dementia-and-the-arts-fiction-films-drama-poetry-painting">an article of the Guardian.</a> </p>

        <p>This is not to propose clinical power of art, rather to show the possibility that art can take as a catalyst for “others” and each individual to see the world of the anxious and agonising. In not a few cases, people suffering from their own agonies do not even consider the sufferings as problems, only denouncing themselves with words like flawed or defective in coping with such problems. I want to focus on this “blind spot” which anyone easily ignores or neglects, unlike issues that are comparatively much more visible and manifest.

        </p>
        <p>
            Each of the artworks discussed in this article shows the role of art to reveal the parts of people, which easily go unnoticed, mysterious, and even cryptic. The parts are never trivial regardless of their obscurity. They all are crucial to lives of us and those of others that experience them. For they affect the way we live by with others as they mold our views towards others. As we saw, a personal documentation of William Styron ignited stories of others having similar sufferings. A mere separate awareness of a suffering by any kind is capable of becoming a collective action towards the issue. Like Leyland James Kirby said, art can give an understanding of sufferings that people cannot actually “feel.” 
            </p>
            <p>
        Art presents visibility to sufferings that are practically invisible in our society. Undiscussed, or silently discussed, sufferings can never be considered serious as nobody knows what it is like and how it is to gauge hardships people suffer from let alone those actually suffering. Art opens a discussion by which we obtain a chance to grasp and to empathise with sufferings of others and ourselves.
