        I think art can help people to reflect upon themselves in terms of what they feel and how they feel. In this sense, this article is focused on “mindfulness;” to shed light upon the role of socially engaged art as a medium to relieving those who suffer from daily, or even serious, mental problems. But how? 
        </p>
        <p>Stress and anxiety have to be distinguished to make the discussion specific. Anxiety need not necessarily have a specific trigger while stress has one. Then anxiety makes a feeling that is unclear even to a person who is experiencing it with having the person suffer from it. Stress is resolved when the trigger for it disappears. But anxiety is not dependent on such a trigger as mentioned above. </p>

        <p>Thus, I think that it is a requirement that people be able to reflect upon their anxiety to deal with their mental problems with mindfulness in order to soothe themselves from anxiety that cannot be handled by removing some “causes.” Arts that describe feelings or experiences of artists’ suffering from their own mental problems can surely help audiences contemplate on their own “worlds” through what surfaces on the arts. By this aspect of arts, each individual that appreciates the artworks will have an opportunity to look at their “suffering” from lenses of others. As what mindfulness does, the very act of recognising what is going on around one’s mind can help them overcome those sufferings. </p>

        <p>Socially engaged art (SEA) can play a role in this sense above in that it can generate a social environment in which people can empathise with those mental issues that should not easily be clouded over with such words as “weak,” “vulnerable,” or “lazy.” SEA also will have individuals with certain mental issues feel safe and secure through arts by facing that their problems are not coming from their incapability that describe such issues. </p>

        <p>This is not to propose clinical power of SEA, rather to show the possibility that SEA can take as a catalyst for “others” to see the world of those mentally anxious. In not a few cases, people suffering from their own mental issues do not even consider the issues as problems, only denouncing themselves with words like flawed or defective in coping with psychological problems. I want to focus on this “blind spot” which anyone easily ignores or neglects, unlike physical issues that are comparatively much more visible and manifest.<p>

        <p style = >
        From Darkness Visible, William Styron wrote “… That the word “indescribable” should present itself is not fortuitous, since it has to be emphasized that if the pain were readily describable most of the countless sufferers from this ancient affliction would have been able to confidently depict for their friends and loved ones ….”, “This memory of my relative indifference is important because such indifference demonstrates powerfully the outsider’s inability to grasp the essence of the illness (depression).” Even for a person like the author who has seriously suffered from and experienced mentally unstable period and is more than capable of describing the world as an established writer, it is not easy to convey what the issue actually implies to comprehend his present, actual status. This leads to blurry and elusive sense of oneself about whether it is a essential “problem.” Further, the action to relieve oneself from such a suffering, which in many cases is expressed in the form of suicide, is unjustly condemned to be nothing but a wrongdoing. 
        </p>
        <p>
        He also showed surprise, in the same piece, that the editorial he wrote to New York Times about the suicide of Primo Levi resonated among many people oppressed but eager to share their feelings that he described in the editorial. The mere action of conveying the phenomenon related to mental issues can help people experience an empathic environment through which they all share and see that they are not left desolate. Additionally, in the part where he describes the moment that he decided to reach out for actual clinical help, it is shown that piece of music, which is one of the most accessible art form in our lives, provoked perception of what he was into.

        <p>There has been a musical project, The Caretaker, by Leyland James Kirby(LJK) for exploring the process of dementia. It is also well-known for the notoriously long and yet full of sad, depressing atmosphere. Not so surprisingly, there used to be a TikTok challenge for listening through “Everywhere at the End of Time” by The Caretaker, which is around 6 hours long. Some argued that it is not just a meme but a real depiction of those sufferings, implying that it has to be respected with sincerity not just as a tool to accomplish an online challenge. The artist, LJK, however, was not bothered with such a challenge. He didn’t feel that the challenge is “disrespecting his work” at all and said “I think that anything that can enable awareness, open a discussion and give people some empathy with people and family members suffering from Alzheimer’s and dementia especially among the young is a good thing.” This quote of his expresses the most significant of aspect of SEA in dealing with issues related with mentality; by raising awareness of mental issues in people, who are outside or inside of the issues, empathic – or even friendly – social atmosphere in our lives can be forged for the matter. </p>

        <p>From the album arts of Everywhere at the End of Time, it is also noticeable that the possibility of art for showing the missing, or blind, spots that people not experiencing such problems would not be able to perceive. It consists of stage I – VI, each of which represents the gradual change of dementia as depicted in each album art.</p>

        <p>Describing a certain aspect of our lives, in this article the instability of our lives, can be effectively done with visual forms as well. From <a href = "https://orominkyung.com/2019">the exhibition 영인과 나비: 끝의 입자 연구소에서 온 편지(Young-In and Butterfly: A Letter Sent from the End of Particle Laboratory)</a> by 오로민경 (Orominkyung) in 2019, the artist conveys a story of a fictional woman, Young-In, alienated from the society of which she was a part. People easily otherised through the features that usual people do not experience or suffer from are abandoned from their societies and even from themselves. </p>
        
        <p>
        For the exhibition, the artist mentioned that she had wanted to make a space where how to live together with ill and vulnerable body can be discussed. Mental vulnerability and instability is one of the matters that can be involved in this discussion. Not only physical disability and social identity (as woman, minority, or etc.), which comparatively more or less surfaces in real life, but also non-evident matters such as mental problems as I articulated thus far is one of the most significant aspect of our lives that needs our attention.

        <p>
        As explained above, art has a possibility of engaging people into discussion of social and, at the same time, somewhat individual features. And yet, we have to note that this discussion is not just for the well-being of one’s own but for the whole scope of the world that we live in. Through this lens that these arts provide, we are able to recognise the various mental issues, which is subtle, unnoticeable, and even latent, that “others” have and people who have pessimistic view of themselves regarding the fact that they suffer from those can eventually perceive themselves as a “well-living human” in their society or world.
