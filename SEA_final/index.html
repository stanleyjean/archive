            I think that art has the power to facilitate deep introspection, enabling individuals to contemplate the profound impact of their own suffering. In this regard, the article aims to shed light on the often overlooked or disregarded aspects of pain and suffering, uncovering the hidden layers that remain obscure to those who do not experience them directly or lack the vocabulary to articulate their inner turmoil. By highlighting the expressive and appealing nature of art, this article endeavors to illuminate the role of art not only in fostering individual self-awareness but also in cultivating a collective consciousness that acknowledges and embraces the suffering of others.
        </p>
        <p class="text">
            I firmly believe that reflecting upon one's suffering, utilizing practices like <a class = "newtab" href= "https://www.mindful.org/meditation/mindfulness-getting-started/">mindfulness</a>, is crucial for comprehending its profound impact. Mindfulness entails being fully present without becoming overwhelmed, allowing us to attentively observe our own state and the world around us. With the concept of mindfulness to contemplate at our sufferings, I aim to underscore the significance of navigating our suffering more consciously through the help of art. This introspection leads me to claim that art, which portrays human pain and suffering, serves as a powerful tool for raising awareness of hidden or unnoticed forms of suffering. It provides us with a lens through which we can vividly recognise and understand the various dimensions of pain and hardship. Art opens up possibilities for exploring and acknowledging invisible sufferings, allowing us to develop a deeper understanding and empathy of the sufferings. In this way, art acts as catalyst, encouraging us to illuminate these sufferings with compassion and empathy.

The first one is a usual self-portrait. All face features are clearly described. The second one has yellow skin-colour with a bit irritated facial expression.

The fourth one shows a bit of tears with confusing background pictures. Face features are much more blurry than other ones. The fifth one doesn't even have any face features discernable. We cannot even call it a &quot face &quot. The sixth one has a nose and mouth but no other face feature. The nose and mouth are properly positioned. And the oval shape, which we could consider as a face, is melting. And there's no colour used here. Only drawn by a pencil."></div>

    <p class = "text">Art not only provides individuals with an opportunity to perceive their own sufferings but also creates a space where others, who may not have experienced or understood these described sufferings, can gain insight into the enigmatic world of suffering. William Utermohlen's artworks depicting the progression of dementia offer a vivid illustration of this concept. His self-portraits depict the gradual changes he experienced while battling dementia. The inner workings of another person's mind are often veiled in mystery. Further, as dementia progresses, "this mystery becomes frighteningly impenetrable," transitioning from "twilight to pitch dark", as described in <a class = "newtab" href = "https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2015/jul/19/dementia-and-the-arts-fiction-films-drama-poetry-painting">an article</a> from The Guardian. Nevertheless, as expressed in the same article, "art, however, can try to enter the silent darkness," suggesting that through art, we can attempt to bridge the gap and gain a sense of the profound experiences of those suffering.</p>


        <p class = "text">This article does not aim to propose the clinical power of art but rather to demonstrate the possibility that art can act as a catalyst for individuals to perceive and understand the world of anxiety and agony. In many cases, even individuals suffering from their own agonies may fail to recognise their sufferings or struggle to articulate the true meaning and impact of their sufferings. I want to draw attention to this blind spot, which is easily overlooked by people but must be acknowledged in order to embrace those who are suffering. What can art do to illuminate these less visible, less understood sufferings of our society?

            In his work <i>Darkness Visible</i>, William Styron reflects on the challenges of describing the experience of suffering, particularly in the context of depression. Styron emphasises the word "indescribable" because it underscores the difficulty in conveying the pain associated with this ancient affliction. He suggests that if the suffering were easily describable, those who endure it would have been able to effectively communicate their experiences to their friends and loved ones. Styron also highlights the author's personal indifference to understand another person’s suffering, implying that the outsider of the suffering is mostly incapable of grasping the essence of depression. I saw, from his writing, that even for someone with first-hand knowledge of the suffering, it remains arduous to accurately convey what the experience truly feels like. I want to emphasise the significant challenge of comprehending and communicating the profound nature of these sufferings, which in essence are invisible and intangible.
        </p>
        <p class = "text">
            In the same piece, Styron expresses his surprise at the resonance of an editorial he wrote for the New York Times concerning the suicide of Primo Levi. He discovered that his words struck a chord among many people who had experienced oppression and were eager to connect and share their similar feelings with what he had described in the editorial. This revelation highlighted the power of conveying the phenomenon related to invisible sufferings. By openly discussing and addressing them, people can create an empathic environment where they realise they are not alone in their struggles. This sense of shared experience can help combat the desolation that individuals may feel, fostering a supportive and understanding community.
            
            <div class = "quote text">“Depression is notoriously hard to describe, but Styron managed to split the atom.” <br> “You are not alone, Styron reminded his readers, and the fog will lift. Patience is paramount.” <br>
                <div style = "text-align: right;">Excerpted from <a class = "newtab" href = "https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2014/12/the-hope-that-william-styrons-darkness-visible-offers-25-years-later/383406/">an article</a> of The Atalantic</div></div>

        <p class = "text">
            
            William Styron's personal account in his work, <i>Darkness Visible</i>, offers a deeply personal and intimate dialogue about his own sufferings. However, the impact of his writings extends beyond mere documentation of his experiences. The letters he received after writing the opinion-editorial for The New York Times and publishing the book serve as evidence of the profound effect his literature has had on others. Through his words, Styron not only helps individuals perceive their own sufferings and realise they are not alone in their solitude but also brings awareness to those who have not experienced such suffering. His piece, then, allows those who are not directly affected by the same struggles to understand and empathise with the experiences of those who are suffering. By portraying the depth and impact of the concealed sufferings, Styron also bridges the gap between the sufferers and those who may be unaware of or distant from such experiences. In this way, he creates a broader understanding and compassion among readers, fostering a sense of solidarity and support for individuals facing various forms of suffering.</p>

        <p class = "text">"The Caretaker" is a notable musical project of Leyland James Kirby (LJK) that delves into the experience of dementia. The project is renowned for an album series of extended duration, <i>Everywhere at the End of Time</i>, and evokes a somber and melancholic atmosphere. </p>

        <p class = "text">Interestingly, there was a TikTok challenge that emerged where participants attempted to listen to the whole series of <i>Everywhere at the End of Time</i> by The Caretaker, a six-hour-long composition. WWhile some criticized the trend of treating it as a mere meme or online challenge, others acknowledged its genuine portrayal of the sufferings associated with dementia. They emphasized the importance of sincere respect rather than trivializing it for the sake of a viral trend. LJK, the artist behind the project, was not bothered by the challenge and did not perceive it as disrespecting his work. In <a class = "newtab" href = "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/23/style/tiktok-caretaker-challenge-dementia.html">an interview</a> with the New York Times, he expressed that anything that promotes awareness, sparks discussions, and fosters empathy for those affected by Alzheimer's and dementia, particularly among younger generations, is beneficial. This quote highlights the profound impact of art in addressing sufferings intangible to ordinary people, by raising awareness among both those directly affected and those not directly related to the sufferings, ultimately fostering an empathetic and supportive social environment.</p>
            

        <p class = "text">Examining the album art of <i>Everywhere at the End of Time</i>, one can observe its potential to illuminate the hidden or obscure aspects that individuals without firsthand experience of dementia might struggle to comprehend. The album is divided into six stages, each represented along with a distinct album art that symbolises the gradual progression of dementia. As demonstrated by the works of William Utermohlen, these artistic creations provide us with an opportunity to acknowledge the overlooked and enigmatic facets of others' experiences. Often, diseases that strip individuals of their human capacities are regarded superficially, merely as surface-level phenomena. However, the work of The Caretaker enables us to immerse ourselves in the actual process and sentiments that individuals suffering from dementia experience.</p>

        <p class = "text">The album series, <i>Everywhere at the End of Time</i>, offers a powerful exploration of dementia. It exemplifies the potential of art to bring awareness to the complexities of intangible sufferings, fostering empathy and understanding among both those directly affected and society at large. Along with the album arts of the series and their depictions of the stages of dementia, <i>Everywhere at the End of Time</i> provides a glimpse into the hidden aspects of this condition, allowing us to grasp the profound experiences of those enduring it.</p>

        <p class = "text"><a class = "newtab" href = "https://orominkyung.com/2019">The exhibition "영인과 나비: 끝의 입자 연구소에서 온 편지" (Young-In and Butterfly: A Letter Sent from the End of Particle Laboratory)</a> by 오로민경 (Orominkyung) effectively captures a certain aspect of our lives, specifically the <a href = "https://www.ukaiddirect.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Defining-marginalised.pdf">marginalisation</a> people experience. Through her artworks, the artist conveys the story of a fictional woman named Young-In, who becomes alienated from the society to which she once belonged. This exhibition explores how individuals who possess characteristics or experiences that differ from the norm are often marginalised, abandoned not only by society but also by themselves.</p>
        
        <p class = "text">In creating this exhibition, the artist expressed her intention to establish a space where discussions about living with an ill and vulnerable body could take place. The discrepancy between societal norms and individual experiences is particularly relevant in Korea, where deviating from social expectations is often frowned upon. People who suffer from less-openly-discussed issues find it uncomfortable to reveal their own sufferings, which may not even be fully understood by themselves or by the majority of society. It seems that the artist, 오로민경, aimed to involve those who are burdened with unusual, or less-understood, qualities into a space where they could engage in conversation with less hesitation about their sufferings. By inviting these individuals into her world of discussion, the artist aimed to shed light on a neglected part of our society that is routinely taken for granted but stays uncomfortable for some in the society. Conscious of this sort of neglects, the artist prioritised accessibility for people using wheelchairs during the exhibition's preparation, which emphasises the need to open our eyes and look beyond what is readily visible to us.</p>

        <p class = "text">The exhibition <i>"영인과 나비: 끝의 입자 연구소에서 온 편지" (Young-In and Butterfly: A Letter Sent from the End of Particle Laboratory)</i> underscores the importance of uncovering the hidden, or easily neglected, aspects of our lives. It highlights the need to create inclusive spaces where individuals with experiences that are less tangible and less visible can openly discuss their struggles and challenges in order to illuminate less understood parts of our society. In this point of view, the artist challenges societal norms and fosters a more empathetic and inclusive society that embraces and addresses the underappreciated aspects of our community.</p>

        <p class = "text">The artworks examined in this article demonstrate the profound impact of art in illuminating the often overlooked and enigmatic aspects of human experience, especially sufferings. Each artwork, whether it be William Styron's introspective writings, Everywhere at the End of Time by The Caretaker, or 오로민경's exhibition <i>영인과 나비</i>, plays a vital role in revealing the hidden sufferings and challenges that individuals can face.</p>
        <p class = "text">William Styron's personal account of depression in <i>Darkness Visible</i> not only allows individuals to recognise their own suffering but also bridges the gap between those who have experienced similar struggles and those that are not familiar with the struggles. The resonance of Styron's writings among his readers emphasises the power of conveying invisible sufferings through art and fostering a sense of shared experience and support.</p>
        <p class = "text">Similarly, The Caretaker's album series, <i>Everywhere at the End of Time</i>, provides a unique insight into the progression of dementia, offering a glimpse into the profound experiences of those affected by the condition. By immersing listeners in the journey of dementia, the album series raises awareness and generates empathy, even among those who have not directly encountered the disease.</p>
        <p class = "text">오로민경's exhibition, <i>영인과 나비</i>, confronts the societal marginalisation faced by individuals with atypical characteristics or experiences. By creating a space for open dialogue and discussion, 오로민경 sheds light on the neglected aspects of our society and challenges societal norms. Through her artwork, she encourages inclusivity, empathy, and a deeper understanding of the struggles faced by individuals who deviate from societal expectations.</p>
        <p class = "text">In each case, art serves as a catalyst for awareness, empathy, and collective action. It allows us to recognise and understand the sufferings of others, even when they are invisible or difficult to comprehend. By fostering discussions and providing a platform for reflection, art enables us to grasp the complexities of human sufferings and fosters a more embracing and supportive society.</p>
        <p class = "text">In a world where some sufferings go unnoticed or are silently discussed, art has the power to bring these sufferings to the forefront and initiate meaningful conversations. It reminds us that our understanding and empathy can extend beyond our own experiences, helping us to connect with the suffering of others and create a more inclusive and embracing world.</p>
        <p class = "text">By exploring the depths of human experience through various art forms, we can gain a unique perspective and a chance to truly empathise with the sufferings of others and ourselves. Art acts as a bridge, allowing us to notice our individual perspectives and engage in collective understanding of those sufferings.</p>
