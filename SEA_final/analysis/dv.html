            From "Darkness Visible", William Styron wrote “… That the word “indescribable” should present itself is not fortuitous, since it has to be emphasized that if the pain were readily describable most of the countless sufferers from this ancient affliction would have been able to confidently depict for their friends and loved ones ….”, “This memory of my relative indifference is important because such indifference demonstrates powerfully the outsider’s inability to grasp the essence of the illness (depression).” Even for a person like the author who has seriously suffered from and experienced unstable period and is more than capable of describing the period as an established writer, it was not easy to convey what the suffering felt like.

            He also showed surprise, in the same piece, that the editorial he wrote to New York Times about the suicide of Primo Levi resonated among many people oppressed but eager to share their similar feelings with what he described in the editorial. The mere action of conveying the phenomenon related to mental issues can help people experience an empathic environment through which they all share and see that they are not left desolate. 
            <div class = "quote">“Depression is notoriously hard to describe, but Styron managed to split the atom.” <br> “You are not alone, Styron reminded his readers, and the fog will lift. Patience is paramount.” <br>

            Especially, the piece of William Styron gives us personal and intimate dialogue of his sufferings. The letters he received after writing the opinion-editorial for The New York Times and publishing the book "Darkness Visible" demonstrate that his writings and literature go beyond simply documenting his own experiences. They help people perceive their sufferings not being left alone in solitude and others empathise with the sufferings present inside of people. </p>
