        <p>Describing a certain aspect of our lives, in this article the instability of our lives, can be effectively done with visual forms as well. From <a class = "newtab" href = "https://orominkyung.com/2019">the exhibition 영인과 나비: 끝의 입자 연구소에서 온 편지(Young-In and Butterfly: A Letter Sent from the End of Particle Laboratory)</a> by 오로민경 (Orominkyung) in 2019, the artist conveys a story of a fictional woman, Young-In, alienated from the society of which she was a part. People easily otherised through the features that usual people do not experience or suffer from are abandoned from their societies and even from themselves.  </p>
        
        <p>
            For the exhibition, the artist mentioned that she had wanted to make a space where how to live together with an ill and vulnerable body can be discussed. I think this is where discrepancy with norms of what we should be or do matters. Especially in Korea, whether good or bad, sticking out of social norms is not considered to be appropriate. For those who suffer from not-so-freely discussed matters, it never is comfortable to reveal their own sufferings that may not be understood even by themselves as one living in the society, and by most of the people of the society. The artist, 오로민경, seems to have wanted to involve those suffering from unusual, or “abnormal,” properties into a place where they can talk with less of hesitation. With involving those people into her world of discussion, the artist tried to show a neglected part of our society, which we routinely take for granted and yet some does not feel comfortable with. She also talked about accessibility of people on wheelchair in the process of preparing the exhibition. The whole picture of the exhibition tells us that we need to look around with opening our eyes to see what we are missing when we are preoccupied with only what is only easily visible to us.
