        <p>There has been a musical project, The Caretaker, by Leyland James Kirby(LJK) for exploring the process of dementia. It is also well-known for the notoriously long and yet full of sad, depressing atmosphere. Not so surprisingly, there used to be a TikTok challenge for listening through “Everywhere at the End of Time” by The Caretaker, which is around 6 hours long. Some argued that it is not just a meme but a real depiction of those sufferings, implying that it has to be respected with sincerity not just as a tool to accomplish an online challenge. The artist, LJK, however, was not bothered with such a challenge. He didn’t feel that the challenge is “disrespecting his work” at all and said “I think that anything that can enable awareness, open a discussion and give people some empathy with people and family members suffering from Alzheimer’s and dementia especially among the young is a good thing” from <a class = "newtab" href = "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/23/style/tiktok-caretaker-challenge-dementia.html">an interview with NYT</a>. This quote of his expresses the most significant of aspect of art in dealing with issues related with mentality; by raising awareness of them in people, who are outside or inside of the issues, empathic – or even friendly – social atmosphere in our lives can be forged for the matter.  </p>

        <p>From the album arts of Everywhere at the End of Time, it is also noticeable that the possibility of art for showing the missing, or blind, spots that people not experiencing such problems would not be able to perceive. It consists of stage I – VI, each of which represents the gradual change of dementia as depicted in each album art. As we saw briefly in the works of William Utermohlen, these arts give us an opportunity to recognise the neglected or mystical part of others that we are unaware of. A mere disease that deprives oneself of capabilities as a human being is easily considered as nothing but a phenomenon that surfaces lightly. The work of The Caretaker lets us feel and see the actual process and sentiments that those suffering from dementia would have. </p>
