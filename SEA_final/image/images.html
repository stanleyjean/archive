All face features are clearly described. The second one has yellow skin-colour with a bit irritated facial expression. The thrid one has eyes located much more below than the other ones. The background colour is total black. And the facial expression shows gloomy atmosphere. The fourth one shows a bit of tears with confusing background pictures. Face features are much more blurry than other ones. The fifth one doesn't even have any face features discernable. We cannot even call it a &quot face &quot. The sixth one has a nose and mouth but no other face feature. The nose and mouth are properly positioned. And the oval shape, which we could consider as a face, is melting. And there's no colour used here. Only drawn by a pencil.">
