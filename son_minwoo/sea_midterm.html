            <p>
                Hong-Goo Kang has held several exhibitions in museums such as Goeun Museum of Photography, <a href = "https://www.mmca.go.kr/eng/">MMCA</a>, <a href = "https://ticket.leeum.org/leeum/personal/exhibitList.do">Leeum Museum</a>, and <a href="https://sema.seoul.go.kr/en/index">SEMA</a>. He won the Artist of the Year for visual art in 2006. He also served as the director of Goeun Museum from 2018 to 2019. 
            </p>
            <p>
                He first started out his career as an artist with drawing, having graduated from Hongik University and the same graduate school with majoring in painting respectively. This background of him is dissolved in his artworks of this exhibition. The artworks are either mere photographs or paintings, or both. He mentioned that the medium he chooses to show certain figures are arbitrary. He said at the artist talk in thie exhibition:
                <div class ="quote">
                    When I think a picture shows what I feel the best, I choose it. Or when I think a painting shows what I feel the best, I choose it. If I need both, I will use both of them.
                </div>
            </p>
            
            <p>
                At the same talk, he mentioned <a href="https://www.hockney.com/home">David Hockney</a> as an example of A-list artists while saying that adopting methodologies used by such an artist as him is not a big problem for a, he said, "B-list" artist like him so long as he can deliver his story well. People unfamiliar with Hong-Goo Kang may feel that his way has similarities with that of Hockney in that he uses <a href = "https://www.anothermag.com/art-photography/3318/top-10-collage-artists-hannah-hoch-to-man-ray">collage</a> in his works by incorporating drawings with photographs. Still, it is interesting that he uses two different mediums for such a work.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                From <a href = "https://youtu.be/TBxEMKmWX0U">an interview<a> with <a href = "https://www.mmca.go.kr/eng/">MMCA</a>, he said that, if he can tell his story with his works, the method to convey his story need not necessarily be creative or antyhing and that, if the story is indeed "my story", how the story is presented is not a problem. In this sense, at the same interview, he calls himself a B-list, or even C-list, artist while mentioning that what it takes about this matter is not relevant for an artwork.
            </p>

            <p><a href = "https://www.sedaily.com/NewsView/29N0FQ33OW" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The exhibition</a> consists of photographs and drawings of Sinan, Hong-Goo Kang's hometown. He didn't mean to gather all the pictures of his place to make them a series. 
                He kept taking pictures to have records of the islands and the like to preserve for himself. Then, at some point, he recognised that those pictures seemed quite meaningful. 
            </p>
            
           
           
                <figure>
                    <img src="./images/haenyeo.jpg" alt ="a fishing boat floating with a &quot;Haeneyo&quot; below" class = "image">
                    <figcaption>Manjaedo, an island of Sinan</figcaption>
                </figure>
            <p>
                From the talk of the artist that I accidentally was able to hear at the exhibition, I found that he is concerned of having fun with working on an artwork or with the artwork itself. The photograph of Manjeado above is splited in half. Then it's not hard to see that the picture is not a single photograph but a combination of the two, by the colour aspects and the pictures not making a synchronised combination. If the picture were a mere big picture, it wouldn't have been so eye-catching as this. Also, the artist himself said that, in the process of merging two seperate pictures, making it decent is not fun. What I think he wants to show is not a single thing but multi-dimensional aspects regarding what it describes. Seeing the seemingly well-merged but actually out-of-sync picture is quite exciting. 
            </p>
                <figure>
                    <img src="./images/jeungdo.jpg" alt = "a house and small stream in front of it" class = "image">
                    <figcaption>A House in Jeungdo, an island of Sinan</figcaption>
                </figure>
            <p>
                What is noticeable about his works is that he interchangeably uses two different mediums. This aspect is shown explicitly in the picture of Jeungdo. At the first glance, it seems like a drawing. Looking at it carefully, it's possible to see the traces of a photograph. I think this is really fun to see. What could've been just a picture of a nice scenery becomes a description, which is not so distant from the reality, that captures the rough but decent feature of the place. I think that this explicitly shows his attitude that conveying the story is the most important, regardless of mediums being used. 
            </p>
                
        
                <!-- <figure>

                    <figcaption>Parts of the Photograph Series, Mooindo</figcaption>
                </figure> -->
                 
                <figure>
                    <img src="./images/mooindo4.jpg" alt = "4 pictures of desert islands in Sinan, each has a drawing of a helicopter, a seagull, ships from the movie Star Wars for 2 pictures resepctively in them"class ="image">
                    <figcaption>Parts of the Photograph Series, Mooindo</figcaption>
                </figure>
            <p>
                He is never reluctant to show that artworks can be meaningful even with lightly chosen objects, such as the Star Wars ships or a big seagull from the pictures above. The artist himself mentioned that he chose the objects, thinking about what he had experienced and seen. Then, he sometimes chooses an object because it's cheap, easily accessible, or just around him at the moment. 
            </p>
            <!-- <p>
                He even mentioned that, while seeing something bizarre or out-of-the-blue features in his works, it is not "required" or "necessary" to feel or see something from them. If anything is felt, then feel it. If not, just stay there. A feature in an artwork can be 
 nothing but a conincidence or an intentionally inserted symbol. Nevertheless, it's up to who sees the art, not even the artist who made and constructed the work.  
                
            </p> -->
            <p>
                I like this soul of him, which lets things flow as they are. These days, a number of artworks try to impose, or imply, some serious meanings to "awaken" audiences. It is even daunting for me to process all the information and emotions accompanied with the artworks. Further, it is even more tiring when those "meaningful" works are complex as themselves. Then, in many cases, the act of appreciating artworks, which in my opinion is supposed to be fun and pleasant, ends up being uncomfortable and even annoying. I am not saying that it's bad to convey thoughts by artworks, but some artworks are so obssessed with showing "meanings" that they miss out the most important feature of an art, which is "fun."
            </p>
            <p>
                What I mean by "fun" above is the pure excitement one gets through an action. The feeling needn't be from external thoughts. I define it as a feeling that springs entirely from one's OWN heart with no guidance regarding what to see or feel.  
            </p>

            <p>
                I was happy to see his artworks that do not try to "threaten" me. Neverthelss, I was able to see his affection towards his place from his attempt to make the islands vivid and lively with his own paintings while not losing his memories from the his younger days and sense of humour. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I asked him at the artist talk: "What makes you choose certain mediums to describe certain things?"
                And he said,
                <div class = "quote">
                    When I think a picture shows what I feel the best, I choose it. Or when I think a painting shows what I feel the best, I choose it. If I need both, I will use both of them.
